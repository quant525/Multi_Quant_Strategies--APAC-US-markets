# üìà Intermarket Trend Divergence Trading Strategy

## üìå Strategy Logic
The Beta Divergence Momentum (BDM) strategy is a directional trading model applied to Taiwan Index Futures (TXF), which exploits structural divergences between the Electronic Futures (TE) and Financial Futures (TF) sectors.

> üéØ This combines **beta exposure (trend direction)** with **alpha generation (inter-sector relative value)** ‚Äî resembling a breakout of a spread.

---

### üíº Capital & Risk Management

- **Macro-Aware Position Sizing:**
  - **Reduce exposure during full-year earnings announcement months.**
  - **In other months**, use **ATR-based position sizing** for volatility adjustment.

Synthetic Asset Construction:
A synthetic ratio is created by dividing the price of Electronic Futures by Financial Futures (TE/TF), forming a relative strength index that reflects sector divergence.

This approach conceptually blends beta directionality (market trend exposure) with an alpha insight (relative value spread between sectors), creating a structural divergence-driven entry mechanism.

Risk & Capital Management:

During annual earnings announcement months, the position size is reduced to manage macro-event risk.

In other months, position sizing is dynamically adjusted using ATR for volatility-based exposure control.

üîπ Optional One-Liner Summary (for README or Pitch Deck):
