## 🌐 Strategic Design Philosophy — All-Weather, Adaptive, Layered
**My trading framework is built upon an all-weather, multi-layered strategy architecture that emphasizes adaptability, causality-driven reasoning, and market regime robustness. Rather than optimizing for a single market condition, I structure strategies to maintain consistent performance across diverse environments — recognizing that recovery from drawdowns demands far greater returns than avoiding them in the first place.**
