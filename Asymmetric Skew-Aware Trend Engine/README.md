## üìà Asymmetric Skew-Aware Trend Engine

## üìå Strategy Rationale

**The Asymmetric Skew-Aware Trend Engine is designed for swing trading applications (currently applied to the Hang Seng Index Futures), integrating multi-layered momentum signals with volatility and skew-adjusted capital scaling.**

‚≠êÔ∏è **Key Highlight:**
#### *Strategy Advantage*
#### What distinguishes this strategy is not just its signal quality, but its dynamic adaptability. Rather than relying on rigid thresholds, the system continuously reevaluates market conditions to decide whether the current environment is statistically suitable for signal activation. This reverses the common approach: instead of forcing trades into static templates, the strategy listens to the market and only acts when the structural context aligns with its core logic.
