# üìà Dynamic Bivariate Regression Regime-Switching Trading Strategy

## üìå Strategy Rationale

The  Dynamic Bivariate Regression Strategy is a **Regime-Switching and hybrid model (Combining Trend-Following and Statistical Mean-Reversion)** designed for the Taiwan Index Futures (TXF) market. It dynamically adjusts its entry and exit logic based on the autocorrelation structure of regression residuals between actual market prices and a predicted regression line.

This regime-adaptive structure allows the strategy to benefit from both trend-following  and statistical mean-reversion regimes based on regression residuals and confidence intervals, improving robustness across different market conditions.

‚≠êÔ∏è **Key Highlight:**
#### *Strategy Advantage*
#### What distinguishes this strategy is not just its signal quality, but its dynamic adaptability. Rather than relying on rigid thresholds, the system continuously reevaluates market conditions to decide whether the current environment is statistically suitable for signal activation. This reverses the common approach: instead of forcing trades into static templates, the strategy listens to the market and only acts when the structural context aligns with its core logic.
